# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

iSKAN

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An innovation of the white cane that will give the user more visibility and awareness.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will be using arduino. We will use a ultrasonic range sensor to detect obstacles within a certain distance from the cane. Then, we will use an arduino UNO to code so that when 
the Ultrasonic range sensor sees an obstacle, it will flash LED lights which will not only alert those around visually impaired users, but also the user since most blind people are 
able to see light. We will be using a case/protective cover to attach it to the cane.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I will be combining this final project with ENGT 4196's final project. (Capstone). The aspects that relate to 1051 would be using arduino and various sensors. Also coding them to 
reach the project's objective of helping visually impaired individuals. The part that relates to 4196 is being an innovative design that would help citizens.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am not collaborating with anyone from 1051, but will be working with two individuals from 4196 named Sean Gallagher(tug99606@temple.edu) and Kendall Heard(tui80173@temple.edu).

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish a good code that will help connect the ultrasonic range sensor sensing an obstacle to the flashing of the LED lights.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is if I am able to make it portable and adjust it in a good way to the white cane.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is to attach it to the cane and find a way to make the whole thing light, weatherproof and adjustable for each user's needs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My Capstone team has already ordered the necessary arduino parts and white cane. We have been doing research and are now on the building phase. For research, we used scholarly
sources as well as conducted various surveys with multiple visually impaired individuals. For building, Kendall and I are working on the code while setting up all of the sensors and 
wires on the breadboard. Sean is working on making a protective case cover for the product.
