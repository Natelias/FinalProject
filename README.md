Project Summary:
My project, iSKAN, is an innovation of the white cane, which is an assistive product that allows visually impaired individuals to navigate. We (my team) took an average foldable white cane that visually impaired individuals use and added arduino components to it so that LED lights would flash once they would sense a person. This would allow not only the user, but also surrounding passer bys to become alerted and help avoid them bumping into the user. In this case we programmed the code to flash three different colored LEDs for the right of the cane, left of the cane and front of the cane. We made the right and left distances 15 inches while the front LED was about 50 inches. So in total, we had two breadboards, three ultrasonic range sensors and three different colored lights.

Difficulties:
It was difficult to find a way to connect it to the cane so that it was not too bulky as we did not want it to exceed 5 lbs. In the end, we designed CAD drawings of custom brackets that we 3D printed to fit all of the arduino items. Also, regarding the code, it was difficult to learn to write the code for three different ultrasonic range sensor, each connecting to their own LED. It was also difficult to construct them on the breadboard together. Also, we were unable to code/add the buzzer which would vibrate the cane because we did not have the time and decided to focus on the LED aspect.

What I learned:
I learned more about the Arduino software as a whole as well as what exactly are the functionalities of the ultrasonic range sensor. It was also very rewarding to then approach various visually impaired individuals regarding the product and see how positively they react to it. 

Final Code Inspiration:
Attached I added two photos of our inspiration for the code. This screenshot is from Kendall and Sean's Electrical & System Devices lab manual, which they had in their notes, and allowed us to start our code. We not only changed the code by adding our own distances for the ultrasonic range sensor, but also, we added to it since we had three ultrasonic range sensors and three different LED lights.
